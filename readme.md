# ESPAT
simple driver made in Zig to use ESP(32/8266) boards as WiFi module via AT command firmware

***Important***: This driver is still under development and invalid inputs will cause errors

__Minimum AT Firmware Version__: 2.2.0.0  

**Warning**: for Ai-thinker modules such as ESP-01 or ESP-12E with Boantong AT firmware it is still possible to use the modes: client only and server only, but be aware that some boards do not provide CTS and RTS pins for UART interface, so you are responsible for ensuring that no data is lost
